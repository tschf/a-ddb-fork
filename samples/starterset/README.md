Example of Image with Starter set data
======================================
This Dockerfile extends the Oracle Database image by creating a sample starter set.

The starterset.sql file is copied into the image which contains the commands for creating the starter set.
This example creates a new user TEST within the ORCLPDB1 PDB and then adds a new table called COOL_PEOPLE.

# How to build and run
First make sure you have built **oracle/database:12.1.0.2-ee**. Now, to build this sample, run:

        docker build --build-arg ORACLE_PWD=<Your DB password> -t example/starterset .

To start the containerized Oracle Database, run:

        docker run --name starterset -p 1521:1521 example/starterset

After the container is up and running you can connect with the TEST user and query the table COOL_PEOPLE:

        sql test/test@//localhost:1521/ORCLPDB1
